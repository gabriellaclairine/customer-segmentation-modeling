# üõçÔ∏è Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning

This project applies **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning** to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, clustering, evaluation, and business insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **EDA**  
   - Explored data distributions and correlations.  
   - Visualized customer demographics and purchase behavior.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.  
   - Engineered additional features such as total spending.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers.  
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using elbow method and silhouette score.  
   - Validated segmentation quality with visualizations and metrics.  

4. **Evaluation & Insights**  
   - Interpreted each customer group based on income, family, and spending patterns.  
   - Suggested potential marketing strategies for different segments.

## üìà Results and Conclusion

- Customers were successfully grouped into **distinct clusters** with meaningful differences in demographics and spending.  
- Segmentation revealed targetable groups such as **high-value buyers**, **family households**, and **budget-conscious customers**.  
- This approach provides actionable insights for **personalized marketing and customer retention strategies**.  

**Future work**:
- Test alternative clustering methods (DBSCAN, hierarchical).  
- Apply supervised ML to predict customer lifetime value or churn.  
- Integrate temporal purchase patterns for dynamic segmentation.
