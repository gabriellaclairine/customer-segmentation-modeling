## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Inspected data structure, missing values, and distributions.  
   - Visualized demographics and spending across product categories.  

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Scaled numerical features.  
   - Engineered new features such as total spending and family size.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers.  
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette score.  
   - Reduced dimensions with **PCA** for visualization.  

4. **Insights & Visualization**  
   - Analyzed cluster profiles (e.g., high-value buyers, families, budget-conscious customers).  
   - Suggested marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
